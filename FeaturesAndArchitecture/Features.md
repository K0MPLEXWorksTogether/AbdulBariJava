# Java's Features

1. Simple: Java is not simple. It is simple in the sense that a programmer approaching java from C or C++ may find it's syntax similar.

2. Secure: JVM's verifier does not allow the execution of injected or mallicious code on the machine.

3. Portable: Java programs can run on any operating system.

4. Object-Oriented: Java supports object-oriented paradigm for programming.

5. Robust: Java ensures that a program keeps executing even when it has encountered runtime errors, or exceptions. This is achieved via a feature known as exception handling.

6. Multithreadded: Java programs can execute on multiple threads.

7. Architecture Neutral: Java programs can run on any system architecture, be it x86-64, ARM, x86-32.

8. Interpreted: Java does not generate machine-specific binaries, but execute its own bytecode.

9. High Performance: Due to the addition of a JIT compiler to JVM's execution engine, java is fast.

10. Distributed: Java programs running on distributed system can collaborate with each oteher.

11. Dynamic: A running program on a distributed system can be moved from one place to another.
