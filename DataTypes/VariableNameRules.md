# Rules For Naming Variables In Java

- **Case Sensitivity:** `a` and `A` are treated differently by java. 
- **Character Set:** All uppercase, lowercase characters, numbers, $ and _.
- **Starting Variables:** Only with alphabets, $ and _.
- **Keyword Restrictions: ** Java's compiler maintains some meaning for some words like `int`, or `for`. These words cannot be used as variable names.
- **Built-In Classes:** A variable cannot be named a Built-In Class.
- **Length:** There is no character limit on the length of a variable.
- **Naming Convention:** Java, internaly uses camel casing for naming variables. Using camel casing for writing your own programs will be clean.
